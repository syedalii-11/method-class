Explanation of the Code:

 

1. Class Definition:

 

MathOperations is the class containing the PerformOperation method.

 

The method takes two integers (num1, num2), adds 10 to num1, and then displays num2 and the result of the math operation.

 

2. Method Call:

 

In the Main() method, I instantiate the MathOperations class.

 

Then, I call PerformOperation() with two numbers, first with positional arguments (5 and 8), and later with named parameters (num1: 15, num2: 20).
